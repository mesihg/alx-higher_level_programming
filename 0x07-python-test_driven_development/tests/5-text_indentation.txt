Using ``text_indentation``
=====================


``text_indentation(text)`` prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :.
  First import ``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module:

Import the function from the module:
    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

Testing with empty:
    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'


Testing with None input:
    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
    

Testing with  character(?) from the given character group:
    >>> text_indentation("How are you doing?")
    How are you doing?



Testing with empty string:
    >>> text_indentation("")

Testing with space at the beginning of the text:
    >>> text_indentation("  How are you doing?")
    How are you doing?



Testing with all the character groups within the text:
    >>> text_indentation("How are you doing.?:")
    How are you doing.
